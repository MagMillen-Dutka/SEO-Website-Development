# SEO Website Development

## Description:

SEO is an important part of a website's functionality. It is very important to ensure a clean, functional, styled website is supports accessibility.

This project example showcases my ability to understand the need for changes to image alt-text, as well as following basic principles of design with sequential conditioning through the website. 

For example; All of the <h> tagged sections should run in order through the code - Starting at <h1> and ending at <h6>; Meaning all code flows smoothly.
